# 30 Days ML Kaggle Computation


## Overview:

This application is written with Python script using Numpy, Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib  and scikit learn libraries.


### The main target from this application is:

*  Build a Machine learning model which can predict the best target value with high accuracy.

### I used:

    - LightGBM regressor to bulid the model to predict target.
    - Optuna and Hyperopt for hyperparametares tuning.
    - Kfold Cross-Validation to avoid underfitting and overfitting.

## Conclusions

1. The score metric used in this computation is RMSE.

2. The final RMSE score on train data is  0.7098009932679727.
